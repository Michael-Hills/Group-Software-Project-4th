1.1.4 Technical System Requirements

A Development and operational requirement is the reliance on the Django framework. Currently, Django is free to use, however, if it were to be changed, this cost would have to be taken into consideration.

Our main storage requirement for this project comes from the file size of the Django project, and additionally the file size of the database. Currently the total size of the project sits at 2.62MB while the incomplete and anonymised version of the database sits at 113 KB.

Django doesn't list any minimum requirements for running, however it's recommended to have 8GB of RAM and a low/mid-range CPU. The project was developed in Windows, thus any server purchased to run should also be Windows based, rather than Linux. As this project is expected to be run locally, a potential server cost will be provided, but it is not expected. The main development language is Python, so it is expected that Python will be installed on any machine running the code.

For project development to be completed, it's estimated a total of 120 hours will be needed. This estimate is based on the time development has taken up until this point, and it's projected the difficulty of implementation will not change over the course of completion.

For project maintenance, an estimate of 16 hours per year have been allocated. This is due to the lack of major issues arising from this project. One potential issue is a dependency (as listed in software_bom.xlsx) being updated, which may potentially impact the system functionality. These 16 hours are expected to be used to ensure the project is as up-to-date as possible.
