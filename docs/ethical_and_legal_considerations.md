Our project revolves around handling data concerning clients with mental health issues. This raises many ethical and legal considerations due to confidential information handling. This data includes addresses, phone numbers, age, gender and more sensitive medical data, which would be dangerous if seen by anyone outside the CoLab organisation. To ensure this data is secure we will be implementing security measures against attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, password-based attacks and others. 


During the development of the project, CoLab has provided an anonymised version of the database, with omitted names, phone numbers and email addresses. This means that the team will not be handling sensitive data throughout the development of the project, eliminating the risk of exposing it to people outside of the CoLab staff. After the development and handover is complete, only CoLab staff members with an account and the relevant permissions will be able to see a user's data. The account will require both a username, password and potentially a method of 2FA, to ensure security. Patient data entry can also only be accessed by verified staff members, reducing the risk of inaccurate data.


We must also consider the United Kingdom’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) principles to ensure data is handled in an ethical and legal way. All data gathered is limited to what is relevant for CoLab Exeter’s purposes, following the data minimisation principle and the purpose limitation principle. All data will be kept up to date and as accurate as possible following the accuracy principle and storage limitation principle. Lastly, the data will be processed in a secure and lawful manner that ensures the integrity and confidentiality principle and the lawful, fairness and transparency principle are met. We will also include an easy and quick way for patients to request their data to be deleted from the database.

**CA2 UPDATE:**

The ethical and legal considerations for this project have not changed between CA1 and CA2. This is due to the client not providing any additional personal data, or requesting any additional features that would require consideration. Partial securtiy measures have been implemented from the document above. The HTTPS login functionality has been added, with 2FA being implemented at the later CA3. Each profile has a delete button, to be able to comply quickly and easily with GDPR requests. Furthermore, as the database currently does not contain the clients personal data, the database has not yet been encrypted. This will be implemented by CA3 to ensure project security.

**CA3 UPDATE:**

The ethical and legal considerations put into place have not changed over the course of development. The database has been encrypted to ensure data protection.
