CoLab is a multi-agency wellbeing hub based in Exeter focused on helping people with a complex multitude of issues lead their best lives, and do their best work. They work with a wide variety of other charities to help direct their end users to different providers. For instance, a homeless drug user may be referred to two different charities, each equipped with the tools to help the individual. They also offer in house mental health support, and a sense of community. The overall aim of the charity is to reduce dependencies of these end users on NHS services and reduce 999 callouts.




Currently, end users data is held in a large spreadsheet, and as the list of end users grows, it's slowly becoming unmanageable. The data is stored in an Excel file (.xslx), and for this project an anonymised version of the data was provided. Data analysis on end users data is limited due to the amount of data, and is often carried out in a separate sheet, and involves copying and pasting data to provide statistics and graphs. 




An end user's flow through the charity starts with a “Raise A Concern” form (available on the CoLab website) which provides the main point of data entry. CoLab meets with other charities and creates a plan on how to help the end user in the most effective way. This basic end user data is the first entry point on the spreadsheet for an individual. End users will often have follow ups with the charity to check on progress and see how they can assist, with meeting notes written in the corresponding end users spreadsheet column. A full list of data can be seen below. A successful implementation will ensure that the client can enter the RAC form data on a webpage, along with a plan as discussed with the other charities involved, and be able to add the data to the database in an intuitive way, via a form.




The charity often hosts workshops with the end users, to help engage them with a subject and one another, and often brings a greater sense of community to the individuals, which has proven to be beneficial to their wellbeing. Currently, there is no effective way of storing or relating this data to show the impact this has over time. For this to be implemented, a separate webpage should be created, with a full suite of workshop management tools. The client should be able to easily add, modify, delete and view all the relevant data about a workshop. It is of high importance that the attendees list is easily accessible, and appears on the timeline of a user.




This project involves migrating the existing spreadsheet into a database and creating a secure web interface for viewing and editing end users data. The client should be able to see key user data, such as name, age, their initial plan and others. The client has expressed that a "timeline" would be beneficial to see, making it easy to understand repeated patterns of an end user's behaviour, so they can learn more about an individual's actions, and further aid their work. The page should also include a "Likes" and "Dislikes" section, where the CoLab staff can select areas of each for end user's, to open the potential for matching different clients, to help one another. It is also essential that the client can add events onto an individual's timeline, that are not workshops, with a space for notes about the individual.




Migrating the data is a crucial element of success to this project, as it will allow for simplicity going forward for the charity, and allow them to spend more time with the end user, rather than worrying about the spreadsheet. Ensuring there is a simple to understand web interface is also key to success, as the charity should be able to access an end user's data easily, and be able to view it in a concise manner. This will be developed in an effective end user profile page, with sections so any charity worker can easily learn more about an individual at short notice.




Optional features include being able to export an end user’s profile as a pdf, for easy data sharing between organisations. A large area for potential development is a data dashboard, which will feature the charities set KPIs, to ensure the work is effective, and display the data to prove so. These include engagement levels, gender and age breakdowns. There is also potential to store end user feedback, so the charity can continue to learn from its end users, and what helps them the most. Creating a script to migrate the charity's current user data stored in the spreadsheet would be beneficial. There is also potential for recommending end user’s with similar interests meet together, to increase the sense of community. We must also adhere to GDPR laws, and allow for our client to quickly and easily delete a given user's data.




Deploying this project to the cloud is not a requirement for this project, due to the charities complex data sharing agreements, and fundamental security needs, our initial recommendation is for the charity to host the service locally on the network, and not expose it to the internet. This will ensure end user data is kept secure on-site, and due to the non-complex nature of the project, further development can be carried out easily.
